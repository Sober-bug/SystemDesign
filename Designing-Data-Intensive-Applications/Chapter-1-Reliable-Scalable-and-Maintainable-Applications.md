# Chapter 1. Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications
### Commonly needed functionality in data-intesive applications
1. Store data so that they, or another application, can find it again later (**databases**)
2. Remember the result of expensive operation, to speed up reads (**caches**)
3. Allow users to search data by keyword or filter it in various ways (**search indexes**)
4. Send a message to another process, to be handled asynchronously (**stream processing**)
5. Periodically crunch a large amount of accumulated data (**batch processing**)
